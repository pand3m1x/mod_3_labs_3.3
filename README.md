This is Module 3 Lab 3.3, using Bootstrap/Tailwind to make the Frontend
projects in Lab 3.2

What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?

So, I had started my SBA before my lab 3.3, and I had intended to try both
Tailwind and Bootstrap. But I had only used Bootstrap. I found the whole thing 
to be frustrating. I was able to use a lot of my code from one to the other. But
between the inline coding and implimenting Bootstrap, I felt very limited

How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
By not needing a CSS file, and bouncing between two files.


In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
I would like to always use custom CSS, but I have yet to use Tailwind, and may
find that to be a more enjoyable process. THough I wonder if I learn more with SASS
I might find Bootstrap more rewarding...?
